Limette is a full-stack framework for Lit (Web Components) and Deno. Its main scope is to be a **light** and **fast** framework based on **Web Standards**.

Limette uses **Lit** on client side and **Deno** for the server side. This combination brings a lot of features, like:

- TypeScript ouf of the box
- Web Standards
- Lightweight
- Fast

It's inspired by _Deno Fresh_, but instead of using Preact, Limette uses Lit.

Limette also offers support for Tailwind.
